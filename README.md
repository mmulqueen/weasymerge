WeasyMerge is a utility for doing mail merges from 
a CSV file to multiple PDF files. The PDF is 
generated by [WeasyPrint](https://weasyprint.org/) and templates can be built
using HTML and CSS with [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/) templating.

## Usage

```bash
weasymerge.py --data guests.csv --template invite.html.j2 --output "pdfs/Invite {row_number} {row[Name]}.pdf"
```

The first row of the CSV file is assumed to be the
header row and the header is used as the key for the row 
dictionary.

HTML escaping is on by default in the Jinja2 template.

The row number for the first data row is 1.

WeasyMerge provides "safe" row data to the output filename 
template (ASCII letters, digits, space, underscore, hyphen, 
and dot). Non-ASCII letters are converted to their closest
ASCII equivalent.
